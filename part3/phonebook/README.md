## Part 3 Readme

Completed the backend of this project, as well as the arduous process of linking everything together. I found I enjoyed this processs more than I expected, it's not often I find myself building back-ends because it's much easier to think in front-end.

Integrating to Heroku was tough because they're servers where down when I first initialized the project with them, I didn't realize they were having issues for a couple hours, then didn't realize that because I had created the project during that time it would... never work. All I had to do was create a fresh Heroku repo and remote push to that, then it worked alright. Had to reconfigure the front-end environment variables to still work locally, then once that was setup got to deploy and watch it all come together.

The difference in production vs development builds is entirely in my anxiety, but it feels so real.

Adding MongoDB was surprisingly easy, the only issue I ran into was MongoDB not acceping the Heroku IP address because I had set it to only accept mine.

I skipped the phone number validation questions, I've touched regex before for form validation and know how much of a mess that is, so it's something I'm marking down as "may need help here" but moving on from part 3.

Had a proud moment when I realized I had setup ESLint far before this point, makes me feel like completing this section was earned.

All questions in part 3 complete except 3.19 and 3.20
