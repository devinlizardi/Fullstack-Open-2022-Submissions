# Blog List Development Process
Completed all exercises up to 4.5

I want to learn Lodash because it seems extremely useful for iterating over arrays and objects, something that can be so confusing and slow in Javascript. Going to go back to these questions once I've completed the rest of this part, just want to focus on the testing material at the moment.

## Part 4.b
Establishing work for each exercise
- [x] Refactor backend to async/await
- [x] Refactor backend tests to async/await
