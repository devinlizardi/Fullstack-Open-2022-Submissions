### Development Notes

#### 1.6
Felt good about formatting, not sure if I want to pass text as a prop vs as a child. Since we haven't gotten to that in the course though I'll use what we've covered only so far.

#### 1.11
Didn't have much experience formatting HTML tables, thought this was a good exercise. Would round the ints to make it formatted better but wanted to keep moving.
