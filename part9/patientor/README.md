# Part 9 Exercises
Documenting process of patientor api

## Notes
#### Part c
The last two questions were far more work than expected, validating each field from an unknown object is pretty tedious work. Refactoring the gender field to an `enum` was also more complex than I expected, but after working on my own solution for a bit I went back to the material and adapted what was described in the text. I _wanted_ my first solution to be good enough, but I'm glad I went back to the material and worked through the throught-process more thoroughly.

It was really satisfying when everything clicked together, I think I'm realizing that input validation just... isn't... my... passion.

### Part d
Picking this up after a long break, will update development process so I can have an easier time getting back into it. I'd like to complete this entire course part so I can continue moving through FSO content.
