## Notes
#### Part c
The last two questions were far more work than expected, validating each field from an unknown object is pretty tedious work. Refactoring the gender field to an `enum` was also more complex than I expected, but after working on my own solution for a bit I went back to the material and adapted what was described in the text. I _wanted_ my first solution to be good enough, but I'm glad I went back to the material and worked through the throught-process more thoroughly.

It was really satisfying when everything clicked together, I think I'm realizing that input validation just... isn't... my... passion.
