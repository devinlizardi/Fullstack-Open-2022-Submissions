## Notes
#### Part a
Struggled remembering the new syntax, as well as where the best places to check types were. For instance, `interface` vs `type` seem to be about best practice -- not sure what that means -- and there's definitely a temptation to explicitly type _everything_.

When it came to the rating descriptions my instinct was to save the available options in an object, that way I could populate it easier and add more if I wanted, but I wasn't sure if this would actually be scalable, it's a little hard-coded. In a development environment I'm not sure where this kind of text written by a copywriter would exist, though I'm certain it would be necessary to make it editable with ease.

#### Part b
Connecting the functions I wrote in 9.1 - 9.3 to endpoints on the express server presented many more challenges than I expected. I didn't know where to handle errors, but I feel confident about my solution and how it works given the question specificity. I like that TypeScript forces you to think about not just what types of variables you're throwing around, but also where you want them to be defined. It's a challenge to get used to because it demands a little refactoring _while_ coding, but getting used to that kind of thinking will be helpful long-term.

Thanks for the challenges again!
